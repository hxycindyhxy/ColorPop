### 🖍️ ColorPop — A SwiftUI Color Palette Generator

A sleek and intu
itive iOS app that generates color palettes based on user-defined keywords. Designed, built, and tested within just one day during the iOS Hackathon 2025, this prototype demonstrates rapid design thinking, efficient SwiftUI development, and practical problem-solving — all using MVVM architecture.

### 📖 The Story Behind

As a former designer, I often found myself carrying a thick color palette book to client meetings — flipping through pages to find the right combination. At other times, I'd spend hours browsing online just to discover a palette that felt “right” for a brand, a mood, or a theme.

ColorPop was born from this real-world frustration. It's a lightweight, mobile-first solution to simplify how we explore and access curated colors. With just a keyword and a swipe, users can instantly get a visually pleasing palette — no bulky tools, no web searches. It's built for creatives, marketers, and developers who want to find color inspiration quickly and effortlessly.

### 📱 Features

* 🎨 Minimalist and modern UI, optimized for both iPhone and iPad

* 🔍 Keyword-based palette generation using a small custom color library

* 🔄 Pull-to-refresh to get a brand-new color palette in seconds

* 🔢 Displays hex codes for each color in the palette

* 📋 Tap any color to instantly copy its hex code to clipboard

* 🧪 Clean, modular SwiftUI code structured with MVVM architecture

### 🧪 Prototype Notes
⚠️ This app is currently in its testing prototype phase.

The color matching logic is based on a small internal library built by our hackathon team. Future upgrades could include integrating a larger dataset, AI-driven color association, and advanced palette suggestions based on user preferences or design trends.

### 🧠 What I Learned
* 🎙 Storytelling for User-Centered Design
I learned how to frame a real-world frustration — searching for matching color palettes — into a compelling story that guided our design choices and helped clarify the app's purpose from the user's point of view.

* 🤝 Teamwork and Collaborative Problem Solving
Working closely with team members, we brainstormed around a shared problem and transformed it into an intuitive, easy-to-use app. It strengthened my ability to communicate ideas, divide responsibilities, and align on user experience goals.

* ⏱ Time and Project Management Under Pressure
With just one day to complete the project from idea to working prototype, I improved how I scope features, prioritize tasks, and adapt quickly. We split responsibilities efficiently, which taught me how to balance speed with quality in a fast-paced environment.
